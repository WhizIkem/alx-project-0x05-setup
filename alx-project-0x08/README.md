# ALX Project 0x08 – Application of State

This project is a continuation of `alx-project-0x07`, aimed at enhancing the image generation app by implementing **React state management** to handle user input, loading status, and generated images dynamically.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to introduce basic state management to our React + Next.js application, making it more interactive by tracking:
- User prompt input
- Image loading state
- List of generated images

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React Hooks** (`useState`)

---

## 🚀 How the App Works

1. User types a **prompt** into the input field.
2. User clicks the **"Generate Image"** button.
3. A loading state is tracked using `isLoading`.
4. Generated images and prompts are tracked using `generatedImages` state.
5. Images are displayed using a reusable `ImageCard` component.
